// Arithmetic Operations


// 1. Addition
// Create two variables, num1 and num2, and assign them any two numbers of your choice.
// Add the two numbers and store the result in a new variable called sum.
// Print the result using console.log().
let num1 = 17;
let num2 = 29;

let add = num1 + num2; 



// 2. Subtraction
// Subtract num2 from num1 and store the result in a new variable called difference.
// Print the result.

let subtract = num1 - num2;

// 3. Multiplication
// Multiply num1 by num2 and store the result in a new variable called product.
// Print the result.

let multiply = num1 * num2;


// String Operations

// 4. Concatenation with +
// Create two string variables, str1 and str2, and assign them any two strings of your choice.
let word1 = "Alexis";
let word2 = "Martinez";

let str1 = word1 + word2;
let str2 = word2 + word1;

// Concatenate (combine) the two strings using the + operator and store the result in a new variable called combinedString.
// Print the result.
